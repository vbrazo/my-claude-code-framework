Set up monitoring and alerting for app and infrastructure metrics.

## Steps


1. Define what to monitor:
2. Choose the monitoring stack:
3. Instrument the application:
4. Configure alerting rules:
5. Set up notification channels:
6. Create runbooks for each alert.
7. Test the monitoring by simulating failure scenarios.

## Format


```
Monitoring: <service name>
Stack: <tools used>
Metrics:
  - <metric name>: <type> (<threshold>)
```


## Rules

- Alert on symptoms (error rate), not causes (CPU usage).
- Every alert must have a runbook with resolution steps.
- Avoid alert fatigue: only alert on actionable conditions.
