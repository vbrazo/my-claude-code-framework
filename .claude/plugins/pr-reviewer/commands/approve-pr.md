Approve a pull request once it clears the quality bar.

## Steps

1. Fetch PR details and verify it has been reviewed: `gh pr view <number>`.
2. Run the approval checklist:
   - [ ] PR description is clear and explains the motivation.
   - [ ] All CI checks are passing: `gh pr checks <number>`.
   - [ ] Tests are included for new functionality.
   - [ ] No secrets or credentials in the diff.
   - [ ] No critical code review findings unresolved.
   - [ ] Branch is up to date with base.
3. If all checks pass, submit approval:
   - `gh pr review <number> --approve --body "<summary>"`.
4. If checks fail, report which items need attention.
5. Optionally enable auto-merge if configured:
   - `gh pr merge <number> --auto --squash`.
