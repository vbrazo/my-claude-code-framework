Build a React Native native module to bridge platform-specific features.

## Steps


1. Define the native module interface:
2. Create the TypeScript interface:
3. Implement the iOS native code (Swift/Objective-C):
4. Implement the Android native code (Kotlin/Java):
5. Handle platform differences:
6. Test the module on both platforms.
7. Document the module API and usage.

## Format


```
Module: <name>
Methods:
  - <method>(params): <return type>
Events:
```


## Rules

- Always provide TypeScript types for the module interface.
- Handle errors consistently across both platforms.
- Use promises over callbacks for async operations.
