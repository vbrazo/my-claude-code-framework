Examine queries for performance problems using EXPLAIN plans and access patterns.

## Steps


1. Identify the slow or problematic query:
2. Run EXPLAIN (or EXPLAIN ANALYZE) on the query:
3. Analyze common performance issues:
4. Check for lock contention:
5. Suggest optimizations:
6. Estimate improvement from each suggestion.

## Format


```
Query: <simplified query>
Current Time: <execution time>
Issues Found:
  - <issue>: <impact>
```


## Rules

- Always use EXPLAIN ANALYZE for real execution statistics.
- Consider the query frequency when prioritizing optimizations.
- Test optimizations on a staging environment first.
