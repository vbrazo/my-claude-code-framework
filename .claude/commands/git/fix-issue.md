Fix a GitHub issue by number — read it, branch, implement the fix, and open a PR.

## Steps

1. Fetch the issue details using `gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels,assignees`.
2. Parse the issue body to understand the problem, expected behavior, and reproduction steps.
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b fix/<number>-<slug>` where slug is derived from the title.
4. Analyze the codebase to locate relevant files mentioned in or related to the issue.
5. Implement the fix:
   - Make minimal, focused changes that address only the reported problem.
   - Add or update tests that cover the fixed behavior.
6. Run the project test suite to verify the fix does not introduce regressions.
7. Commit changes with `fix: <title> (closes #<number>)`.
8. Push the branch and create a PR: `gh pr create --title "Fix #<number>: <title>" --body "Closes #<number>"`.
